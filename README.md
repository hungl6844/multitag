# multitag

`multitag` is a Rust crate for reading and writing music metadata in a variety of formats. It aims to fix some of the issues present in `audiotag`, such as adding `wav` file support.

It currently supports reading and writing metadata to mp3, wav, aiff, flac, and mp4/m4a/... files, with support for more formats on the way.
